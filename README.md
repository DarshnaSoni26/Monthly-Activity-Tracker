# Monthly Activity Tracker

The Monthly Activity Tracker is a simple web application that allows users to track their daily activities on a monthly basis. It consists of three main components: `Addact.js`, `Activity.js`, and `Days.js`. Activities are stored in the browser's `localStorage` for persistence across sessions.
